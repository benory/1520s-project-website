Digital tools have dramatically changed the ways in which we interact with texts. When we want to read a play by Shakespeare, we take for granted the ability to access the work online and search for individual words or phrases. We can equally visualize relationships across the entire Shakespeare corpus. Indeed, we now take such tools more or less for granted. 

But when it comes to Western music, this sort of engagement is mostly not yet possible. Together with the [Josquin Research Project](http://josquin.stanford.edu), the 1520s Project aims to encompass a repertory spanning rough ca. 1420–1540. 

Our ultimate goal is nothing less than to change how people engage with music of the Renaissance.

### A New Aesthetic Paradigm

Sometime during the 1520s, a new aesthetic paradigm for sacred European art music took hold. Musical sources from this decade evince a decisive stylistic change: in place of the contrastive aesthetic preferred by earlier composers, with individual lines coming and going, we now find nearly pervasive sonic saturation–-that is, music for five or six independent voices with relatively few rests. 

This new style, although easy enough to describe in general terms, is not so easy to analyze. Making matters still more difficult is that scholars have long been unsure exactly how, when, and where these stylistic changes occurred, owing to limited information about composer biographies and a fuzzy understanding of seminal musical sources from the 1520s. As a result, historians have tended to tell an oversimplified story that prioritizes the major composers at the chronological edges of this period at the expense of those in between. 

The problem gets only more complicated: more works from during this decade survive than from any previous one in Western music history. Indeed, more works survive than any individual scholar can hope to control.

The 1520s Project aims to meet this challenge head on. And with 250 scores already avialable, it’s the largest online database of music for this period in the world.
