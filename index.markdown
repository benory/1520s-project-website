## The 1520s Project

The 1520s Project is an open-source repository of more than 250 scores of European polyphonic music from ca. 1510 through ca. 1530. Founded in 2019 by [Benjamin Ory](https://www.benjaminory.com){:target="_blank"}, it seeks to address how, when, and where a radically new style of polyphonic music emerged in the 1520s.
